Inversion of Control:
        -The approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects
        -it's nothing but the application gonna outsource the construction and managemnet of objects ,it will be handled by object factory(Bean Factory)
        -
Dependency Injection:
        - outsource the construction and injection of ur objects to external entity.
        - allow the program design to follow the dependency injection principle.
        - "dependency "same thing as "helper objects"

    Injection Types:
            1. Constructor Injection
            2. Setter Injection
        
        Development Process : Constructor Injection
            1. Define the dependency interface and class
            2. Create a constructor in your class for injections
            3. Configure the dependency injection in Spring config file

        Development Process : Setter Injection
            1. Create a setter method in the class
            2. configure the setter in the config
            3. retreive it
