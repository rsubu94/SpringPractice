Spring - it is an framework to ease the Java EE development
       - current version is 5
       - Lightweight framework 
       - work with java pojo
       - DI to promote loose coupling
       - AOP 
       - minimize boiler-plate code
       
Core Container -
            
                Beans(main) - bean factory to create beans
                    Spring Bean - When java objects are created by the spring container,then spring refers to them as "Spring Beans"
                Core 
                spEL - spring expression language
                Context
                
Infrastructure :
Aspect Oriented Programming(AOP) -
        
            - Used to create applicationwide services like 
              logging,security,instrumentation,transactions
              
Data Access Layer - to communicate with database like JDBC
                    Using spring jdbc helper we can reduce the code to 50%
                    
                    ORM - object relational mapping like hibernate 
       
Spring Containers or generally known as ApplicationContext:
    Primary Functions:
            1. Inversion of Control
            2. Dependency Injection
            
    Configuring Spring Container;
            1. XML Configuration (Legacy Process)
            2. Java Annotations
            3. Java Source Code
            
    Spring Development Process:
            1. Configure  your Spring Beans
            2. Create a Spring container
            3. retreive beans from spring containers
