Java Annotations:
        1. Special labels/markers added to the class
        2. Provide metadata about the class
        3. Processes at compile-time or run-time for special processing

Disadv of using XML annotations:
        1.It is verbose
        
With annotation what Spring will do
        
            1. Scan your classes for java annotations.
            2. Automatically register the beans in the spring container.
            
Development Process:
        
        1. Enable the component scanning in the config file
        2. Add @Component annotations to the class
        3. retreive it from spring container
