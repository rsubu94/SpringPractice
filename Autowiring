Spring Autowiring:
    1. For Dependency Injection spring can use autowiring
    2. Spring will look for a class that matches the property
            matches by type : class or interface
    3. Then spring inject it automatically ..hence it is autowiring

Autowiring Injection Types:
    
    1. Constructor Injection
    2. Setter Injection
    3. Field Injections - Injecting dependencies by setting field values on your class directly (even private fields).
                            It is accomplished by Reflection
